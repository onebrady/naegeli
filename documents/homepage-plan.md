# Homepage Redesign Plan for HeavyHaulTexas.com

## Objectives & Audience
- Convert industrial buyers who need heavy-haul trucking and crane/rigging support into quote requests or direct calls.

## Content & Copy Guidelines
- Tone: authoritative, service-oriented, plain-language with industry terminology when it adds credibility.
- Lead with outcomes (safe, on-time heavy moves) before listing equipment.
- Use scannable formatting: subheads, bullet lists, pull quotes, iconography.
- Reuse tagline “Let Us Pull Your Weight” in hero or trust band to tie back to brand voice.
- Promote certifications and compliance in both copy and visual badges.

## Visual & Media Direction
- Color palette anchored in black/charcoal, Naegeli orange `#ff6b00`, and steel gray neutrals (per HTML sample).
- Photography: real fleet shots showing cranes lifting, multi-axle trucks, rigging crews in PPE. If stock is necessary, choose industrial realism.
- Use background textures sparingly (metal grates, blueprint lines) to avoid clutter and maintain fast load times.
- Responsive layout: ensure hero text remains readable on mobile; collapse grids into vertical stacks with clear separators.

## Conversion & Lead Capture Strategy
- Primary CTA (Request a Quote) should appear in header, hero, mid-page (after services), within testimonials, and before footer.
- Enable click-to-call buttons on mobile; display toll-free number for out-of-region prospects.
- Quote form should support file uploads (photos, load sheets) if feasible; otherwise provide instructions/email.
- Use tracking for CTA interactions (Google Analytics events) to measure hero vs. mid-page conversions.

## Trust & Compliance Elements
- Display certification badges (DOT, TWIC, Hazmat) near trust band or CTA.
- Include insurance/bonding statement and safety program overview (link to PDF or subpage).
- Feature client logos with permission; ensure grayscale variation for uniformity.
- Consider adding associations or memberships (e.g., SC&RA) if applicable.

## SEO, Accessibility & Performance Checklist
- **Target primary keywords:** "Houston heavy haul transportation," "crane and rigging services Texas," "oversize load transport Houston."
- **Title tag:** "Houston Heavy Haul & Crane Services Since 1956 | Naegeli Transportation"
- **Meta description:** "Expert heavy equipment transport (2,000–200,000 lbs) and crane/rigging services across TX, LA, AR, OK. DOT certified, 70+ vehicles. Request a quote: (713) 946-4000."
- **Structured data:** `LocalBusiness` schema with service area; consider `Service` schema for heavy haul and crane/rigging services.
- **Image optimization:** WebP/AVIF format, ≤200KB per image; lazy-load below-the-fold sections (testimonials, logo bar, fleet gallery).
- **Performance budget:**
  - Total page weight: <1.5MB
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
  - First Input Delay (FID): <100ms
- **Heading hierarchy:** H1 for hero headline, H2 for major section titles, H3 for subsections.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA (≥4.5:1); provide descriptive alt text for all images; ensure forms are keyboard-accessible with clear labels and error states.

## Implementation Notes & Next Steps

### Build Workflow
1. **Stakeholder alignment:** Review this plan with internal team; finalize section priorities and approve messaging.
2. **Wireframing:** Draft desktop and mobile wireframes reflecting section order; iterate based on feedback.
3. **Copy deck:** Write full copy for all sections alongside design phase.

5. **Development:** Build responsive HTML/CSS/JS; ensure smooth scroll to #quote anchor, lazy-loading, and performance targets.
6. **Integrations:** Connect quote form to CRM/email workflow; set up Google Analytics event tracking for CTAs; implement call tracking if needed.
7. **QA:** Test across devices/browsers; verify form submissions route correctly with auto-responders; check accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers).

### Post-Launch
- Monitor conversion metrics (quote submissions, call tracking, CTA click rates)
- Use heatmaps (Hotjar, etc.) to identify user behavior patterns
- Plan A/B tests on hero headline, CTA copy, and testimonial placement
- Gather user feedback and iterate based on data
